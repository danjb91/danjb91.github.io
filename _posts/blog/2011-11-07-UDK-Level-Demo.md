Using the Unreal Development Kit, we were asked to create a level based on the BBC TV Show Dr Who. Being one of my favorite TV shows, I jumped at the challenge and created the level shown in the video above. Since I didn't have access to any custom made models, I made use entirely of those provided with the UDK. The Tardis model was provided by my friend.

The story behind the level is that the Doctor has fallen out of the Time Vortex and crash landed on a nearby planet. Unfortunately for him, the planet is in orbit around a start that is about to go supernova. The player has 5 minutes to complete the level, fix the Tardis by collecting the power cells in the cave. They then have to make it back to the Tardis in time to survive the planet being destoyed.

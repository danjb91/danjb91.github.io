Hey! I'm Dan. I'm a programmer at Ubisoft Reflections. I've got a passion for making great games, and the tools needed for the people making them. We're seeing some major advances in gaming at the moment, both in terms of gameplay, story, animation, computation and simulation. I'm super excited to be part of this journey and to be part of the teams pushing these formidable boundaries forward!

On this site I'll be covering projects I've been working on in my spare time. I'll also be putting out tutorials and articles on interesting topics I encounter on the way. Everything from GPU particles, to quirky things I've found when working with Unity3D.

# Recent Projects

## [Grow Up](http://store.steampowered.com/app/426790/Grow_Up/)

> Leaping from mind-boggling heights, bouncing off Champolines, soaring inches from floating islands, BUD can do it all - that look of mild terror, that’s his daredevil face. Help the adorable little robot collect MOM’s scattered ship parts and return them to the moon.

Grow Up was a follow up to the last project, Grow Home. It expands on the fun in the first game by giving the player a whole planet as their playground. They can approach the game in any way they want, and are provided with the toys to have fun in their own way!

Grow Up was my first project to be at E3! :D

## [Grow Home](http://store.steampowered.com/app/323320/Grow_Home/)

> Experience the freedom of unbounded climbing as you take control of BUD, a procedurally animated robot on a quest to save his planet. Create your own path through an alien world as you control and ride a giant plant on a vertical journey to the stars.

Grow Home was my very first project at Ubisoft Reflections, and is also my first commercially released title.

The game revolves around the character BUD who has been tasked with growing a beanstalk back to his spaceship MOM in order to get the valuable seeds to take back to Earth.

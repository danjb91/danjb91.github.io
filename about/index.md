Hey! I'm Dan. I'm a programmer at Ubisoft Reflections. I've got a passion for making great games, and the tools needed for the people making them. We're seeing some major advances in gaming at the moment, both in terms of gameplay, story, animation, computation and simulation. I'm super excited to be part of this journey and to be part of the teams pushing these formidable boundaries forward!

On this site I'll be covering projects I've been working on in my spare time. I'll also be putting out tutorials and articles on interesting topics I encounter on the way. Everything from GPU particles, to quirky things I've found when working with Unity3D.

## [ATOMEGA](http://store.steampowered.com/app/619880/ATOMEGA/)

> Grow, fight, collect and evade in the last cosmic arena the very end of time. Acquire MASS to evolve your EXOFORM from the nimble ATOM to the godlike OMEGA and compete for fun and dominance in a fast-paced, multiplayer shooter. ATOMEGA™ !

Atomega is my third released title! This has been an incredible project to work on, since it's mechanically based in the FPS genre, which I'm a huge fan of!

The gameplay is a mix between an arena FPS and [agar.io](http://agar.io/). You collect mass to become more powerful, score more points and eventually win the round!

## [Grow Up](http://store.steampowered.com/app/426790/Grow_Up/)

> Leaping from mind-boggling heights, bouncing off Champolines, soaring inches from floating islands, BUD can do it all - that look of mild terror, that’s his daredevil face. Help the adorable little robot collect MOM’s scattered ship parts and return them to the moon.

Grow Up was a follow up to the last project, Grow Home. It expands on the fun in the first game by giving the player a whole planet as their playground. They can approach the game in any way they want, and are provided with the toys to have fun in their own way!

Grow Up was my first project to be at E3! :D

## [Grow Home](http://store.steampowered.com/app/323320/Grow_Home/)

> Experience the freedom of unbounded climbing as you take control of BUD, a procedurally animated robot on a quest to save his planet. Create your own path through an alien world as you control and ride a giant plant on a vertical journey to the stars.

Grow Home was my very first project at Ubisoft Reflections, and is also my first commercially released title.

The game revolves around the character BUD who has been tasked with growing a beanstalk back to his spaceship MOM in order to get the valuable seeds to take back to Earth.
